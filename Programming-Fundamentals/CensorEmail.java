/*
 * You have some text that contains your email address. Youâ€™re sick of spammers, so you want to hide it. 
You decide to censor your email: to replace all characters in it with asterisks ('*') except the domain.
Assume your email address will always be in format [username]@[domain]. 
You need to replace the username with asterisks of equal number of letters and keep the domain unchanged.
